[Verse 1]
Big beats, black cloud
Get it wrong, get loud
Write a song, get down
And everyone will know
And everyone will know
And everyone can go

[Verse 2]
Oh, then, get lost
Take his shit, maybe not
Listen good, he's gone
Everything you know
And everyone should go
Oh-oh-oh-oh

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't need to know
So, do you want to?
Am I just right? (Is it just right?)
Can you see the enemy just isn't me tonight?
Oh, it is perfect
You could be anything out there
Butterflies flying in the air

[Chorus]
Oh, no, it came
Higher than an aeroplane
Don't know this song
Sweeter than a sugar cane
Why you looking for a harmony?
There is harmony in everything
It’s a butterfly whose wings span the world

[Verse 3]
Run away, get caught
Put in cell, livestock
Calculate, old body
Got you moving slow
And everyone will know
And everyone can go

[Verse 4]
Big bird, dead man
Wish I could save them
Don't know, no plan
Everyone can go
And nobody can know
And nobody can know

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't need to know
So, do you want to?
Am I just (am I just?)
Can you see the enemy just isn't me?
Oh, baby, it is perfect
You could be anything out there
Butterflies flying in the air

[Chorus]
Oh, no, it came
Higher than an aeroplane
Don't know this song
Sweeter than a sugar cane
Why you looking for a harmony?
There is harmony in everything
It’s a butterfly whose wings span the world
So fly away

[Bridge]
If you're looking for a dream girl
I'll never be your dream girl
Living in the real world
Looking for a dream girl

[Chorus]
Oh, no, it came
Higher than an aeroplane
Don't know this song
Sweeter than a sugar cane
Why you looking for a harmony?
There is harmony in everything
It’s a butterfly whose wings span the world
So fly away

[Outro]
If you're looking for a dream girl
I'll never be your dream girl
