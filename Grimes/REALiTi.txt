[Intro]
Ees I tahw si siht, pu teg

[Verse]
When we were young, we used to get so close to it
And you were scared and you were beautiful
I wanna peer over the edge and see in death
If we are always the same

[Interlude]
Oh, I fear that no life will ever be like this again
'Cause your love kept me alive and it made me insane, oh, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
There were moments when it seemed okay
(But I go back alone)
Whether you go or whether you stay
(I go back alone)
There was a time when the music would play
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Chorus]
Oh, baby, every morning there are mountains to climb
Taking all my time
Oh, when I get up, this is what I see
Welcome to reality
Oh, baby, every morning there are mountains to climb
Taking all my time
Oh, when I get up, this is what I see
Welcome to reality

[Verse]
When we were young, we used to get so close to it
And you were scared and you were beautiful
I wanna peer over the edge and see in death
If we are always the same, oh, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
There were moments when it seemed okay
(But I go back alone)
Whether you go or whether you stay
(I go back alone)

[Interlude]
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh

[Chorus]
Oh, baby, every morning there are mountains to climb
Taking all my time
Oh, when I get up, this is what I see
Welcome to reality
Oh, baby, every morning there are mountains to climb
Taking all my time
Oh, when I get up, this is what I see
Welcome to reality
To reality

[Outro]
(Give me a sign)
Oh, baby, every
To reality
(Give me a sign)
Oh, baby, every
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh
(Give me a sign)
Oh, baby, every
(Give me a sign)
Oh, baby, every
(Give me a sign)
Oh, baby, every
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh, baby, every
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
(Give me a sign)
Oh, baby, every
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Oh, baby, every
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Oh, baby, every
It sounds like corporate art
Break bread with an infidel
And plunge into the dark
