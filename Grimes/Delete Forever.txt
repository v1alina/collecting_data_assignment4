[Verse 1]
Lying so awake, things I can't escape
Lately, I just turn 'em into demons
Flew into the sun, fucking heroin
Lately, I just turn 'em into reasons and excuses

[Pre-Chorus]
Always down when I'm not up, guess it's just my rotten luck
To fill my time with permanent blue
But I can't see above it, guess I fucking love it
But, oh, I didn't mean to

[Chorus]
I see everything, I see everything
Don't you tell me now that I don't want it
But I did everything, I did everything
More lines on the mirror than a sonnet (Woo)

[Verse 2]
Funny how they think us naive when we're on the brink
Innocence was fleeting like a season
Cannot comprehend, lost so many men
Lately, all their ghosts turn into reasons and excuses

[Pre-Chorus]
Always down when I'm not up, guess it's just my rotten luck
To fill my time with permanent blue
But I can't see above it, guess I fucking love it
But, oh, I didn't mean to

[Chorus]
I see everything, I see everything
Don't you tell me now that I don't want it
But I did everything, I did everything
More lines on the mirror than a sonnet (Woo)

[Chorus]
I see everything, I see everything
Don't you tell me now that I don't want it
But I did everything, I did everything
More lines on the mirror than a sonnet
