# collecting_data_assignment4

## Intended use
The intended use of the collected corpus is the lyrical analysis of singer-songerwiter and producer Grimes. 
Anyone with interest in her musical projects can download and use the corpus.

## Corpus collection and selection
The corpus of 16 songs was manually selected and downloaded via the [Genius artist page of Grimes](https://genius.com/artists/Grimes).
There were several criteria for the song selections:
(1) Grimes was the only singer in the song.
(2) The song is popular amongst Grimes' song searches on Genius as suggested by the view counter.
(3) I tried balancing the corpus by including songs from different EPs and Albums. However, there might be some overrepresentation of songs from the Vision and especially Art Angels albums.

## Metadacta collection
I decided to gather some metadata on the selected corpus of 16 songs. The following values were manually collected for each song via the [Discogs artist page of Grimes](https://www.discogs.com/artist/1993487-Grimes-4):

| title | length |release_year | ablum_title |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| song title | length in minutes | release year in int | album/EP/release title |
