[Verse 1]
Oh, baby, I can't say
That everything is okay
'Cause I have a problem
And I don't know how to stop 'em
But, baby, I can't do
Anything to help you
And I'm working to the bone
And you know it's 'cause we're gonna be alone

[Chorus]
Hey, I'ma, hey, I'ma, ready to say, I'ma
Working to the bone all day, I'ma
Hey, I'ma, hey, I'ma, ready to say, I'ma
Working to the bone all day, I'ma

[Verse 2]
Oh, baby, I can't say
That everything is okay
'Cause I have a problem
And I don't know how to stop 'em
Oh, baby, I can't do
Oh, anything to help you
'Cause I'm working to the bone
And you know, and you know
You're gonna have to play alone

[Chorus]
Hey, I'ma, hey, I'ma, ready to say, I'ma
Working to the bone all day, I'ma
Hey, I'ma, hey, I'ma, ready to say, I'ma
Working to the bone all day, I'ma
Hey, I'ma, hey, I'ma, ready to say, I'ma
Working to the bone all day, I'ma
Hey, I'ma, hey, I'ma, ready to say, I'ma
Working to the bone all day, I'ma
I'ma, I'ma, I'ma, I'ma
I'ma, I'ma, I'ma, I'ma
