[Chorus]
My heart, I never be, I never see, I never know
Oh, heart, and then it falls, and then I fall, and then I know
My heart, I never be, I never see, I never know
Oh, heart, and then it falls, and then I fall, and then I know
My heart, I never be, I never see, I never know
Oh, heart, and then it falls, and then I fall, and then I know
My heart, I never be, I never see, I never know
Oh, heart, and then it falls, and then I fall, and then I know

[Post-Chorus]
My
My
My
Ever see, ever be, ever know my heart (My)
Ever see, ever be, ever know my heart

[Refrain]
Home, and they know
I'm the vagabond
It's always different
I'm the one in love
Home, and they know
I'm the vagabond
It's always different
I'm the one in love
Home, and they know
I'm the vagabond
It's always different (I'm the one in love)
I'm the one in love
Home, and they know
I'm the vagabond
It's always different (I'm the one in love)
I'm the one in love

[Chorus]
My heart, I never be, I never see, I never know
Oh, heart, and then it falls, and then I fall, and then I know
My heart, I never be, I never see, I never know
Oh, heart, and then it falls, and then I fall, and then I know

[Post-Chorus]
Ever see, ever be, ever know my heart
Ever see, ever be, ever know

[Refrain]
Home, and they know
I'm the vagabond
It's always different
I'm the one in love
Home, and they know
I'm the vagabond
It's always different
I'm the one in love
Home, and they know
I'm the vagabond
It's always different
I'm the one in love
Home, and they know
I'm the vagabond
It's always different
I'm the one in love
