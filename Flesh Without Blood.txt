[Intro]
Ooh, ah-ah
Ooh, ah-ah

[Verse 1]
You claw, you fight, you lose, got a doll that looks just like you
Remember when we used to say, "I love you" almost every day
I saw the light in you, you going out as I close our window
You never liked me anyway

[Pre-Chorus]
Aye-yeah, aye-yeah
Aye, I don't see the light I saw in you before
And no, I don't, and no, I don't
And no, I don't care anymore

[Chorus]
(Now you’ll never know) Baby, believe me
And you had every chance you destroy everything that you know
(Uncontrollable) If you don't need me
Just let me go

[Verse 2]
You hate, you bite, you lose after all, I just don't like you
It's nice that you say you like me, but only conditionally
Your voice, it had the perfect glow it got lost when you gave it up though
Cause you want money, you want fame

[Pre-Chorus]
Aye-yeah, aye-yeah
Aye, I don't see the light I saw in you before
And no, I don't, and no, I don't
And no, I don't care anymore

[Chorus]
(Now you’ll never know) Baby, believe me
And you had every chance you destroy everything that you know
(Uncontrollable) If you don't need me
Just let me go

[Bridge]
Ooh-oh-oh-oh, ooh-oh-oh-oh
Hey, hey, sing along, baby, then your heart beats on this sad song (Ooh-oh-oh-oh)
Underground, underneath me and the big things we could’ve had, ooh-oh-oh
Hey, hey, oh no (Then your heart beats underground now)

[Chorus]
(Now you’ll never know) Baby, believe me
(Then your heart beats underground now)
And you had every chance you destroy everything that you know
(Then your heart beats underground now)
(Uncontrollable) If you don't need me
(Then your heart beats underground now)
Just let me go
(Then your heart beats underground now)
(Now you’ll never know) Baby, believe me
And you had every chance you destroy everything that you know
(Uncontrollable) If you don't need me
Just let me go
(Then your heart beats underground now)

[Outro]
(Now you’ll never know) Aah-ah ah
(Then your heart beats underground now) Aah-ah-ah
(Uncontrollable) Aah-ah-ah
Ah-ah, aah-ah-ah
