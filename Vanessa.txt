[Intro]
I've been

[Verse 1]
Oh, I've been waiting destiny
And my heart is here right next to me
And I'm caught waiting in the rain
Oh, I've been waiting destiny
And my heart is here right next to me
And I'm caught waiting in the rain

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know and I need you in the storm
And I oh-oh-oh-I-I, oh-oh-oh-I-I-I-I

[Chorus]
Hey, hey, you want to play
Well baby, I can go and go
And every other day you're running off with so and so
Well baby, I would throw you if I didn't know you
But I'm paying for it
Hey, hey, you want to play
Well baby, I can go and go
And every other day you're running off with so and so
Well baby, I would throw you if I didn't know you
But I'm paying for it
Baby I would throw you, if I didn't know you
But I'm paying for it

[Verse 2]
I hold on, and I don't care what you say
But the way it goes it's happening everyday
I can see space on the radio
I can see space on the radio
I hold on, and I don't care what you say
I can see space on the radio
But the way it goes it's still happening everyday
I can see space on the radio

[Bridge]
Everyday, everyday, everyday, everyday
Everyday-day-y-day-y-day, everyday-y-day-y-day
Everyday-y-day-y-day

[Chorus]
Hey, hey, you want to play
Well baby, I can go and go
And every other day you're running off with so and so
Well baby, I would throw you if I didn't know you
But I'm paying for it
Hey, hey, you want to play
Well baby, I can go and go
And every other day you're running off with so and so
Well baby, I would throw you if I didn't know you
But I'm paying for it
Hey, hey, you want to play
Well baby, I can go and go
And every other day you're running off with so and so
Well baby, I would throw you if I didn't know you
But I'm paying for it
Hey, hey, you want to play
Well baby, I can go and go
And every other day you're running off with so and so
Well baby, I would throw you if I didn't know you
But I'm paying for it
Baby, I would throw you if I didn't know you
But I'm paying for it
