[Verse 1]
This, this music makes me cry
It sounds just like my soul
But I'm not ready to win
Oh Lord, cause I don't wanna know what they say
'Cause I get carried away
Commodifying all the pain

[Pre-Chorus]
The things they see in me, I cannot see myself
When you get bored of me, I'll be back on the shelf
And when the ocean rises up above the ground
Maybe I'll drown in–

[Chorus]
Ca-ah-ah-ah, California
You only like me when you think I'm looking sad
Ca-ah-ah-ah, California
I didn't think you'd end up treating me so bad

[Verse 2]
Oh (Ah-ah-ah)
Come Monday, it's a dream (Ah-ah-ah)
Broken my own heart again
Chasing something beautiful
Oh Lord, but I don't understand what they say
'Cause I get carried away
Commodifying all the pain

[Pre-Chorus]
The things they see in me, I cannot see myself
When you get bored of me, I'll be back on the shelf
And when the ocean rises up above the ground
Maybe I'll drown in–

[Chorus]
Ca-ah-ah-ah, California
You only like me when you think I'm looking sad
Ca-ah-ah-ah, California
I didn't think you'd end up treating me so bad
Ca-ah-ah-ah, California
You only like me when you think I'm looking sad
Ca-ah-ah-ah, California
I didn't think you'd end up treating me so bad

[Outro]
Oh I, eh, I
Oh na, na, na, ne
Oh I, eh, I
Oh na, na, na, ne
